# Why I Value Niche Technical Skills — Even Proprietary Ones

## An open-source manifesto for real liberation

Open source, at its best, is about freedom — freedom from obscurity, stagnation, and arbitrary gatekeepers. I believe in it not because it’s easy, but because it’s necessary.

But to make that freedom real, to help people and organizations escape lock-in and reclaim agency, open source must meet the closed world where it actually exists. And to do that, we need niche technical expertise,including in proprietary technologies.

## Freedom Must Be Practicable

Open source ideology inspires thousands to build alternatives. But most real systems in the world are not written in open languages or standards. They are built on:

 - proprietary languages and runtimes
 - vendor-specific APIs
 - opaque data formats
 - closed ecosystems

Telling teams to “just adopt open source” without understanding what they depend on is idealism, not strategy.

To free someone from a closed system, you must first understand that system deeply.

## Liberation Requires Deep Understanding

Niche, proprietary, or uncommon technical skills are not endorsements of lock-in. They are tools for liberation.

When we understand the internals of a proprietary system, its semantics, its constraints, its data flows, we can:

 - design safe exit strategies
 - translate legacy logic into open alternatives
 - recover data locked in inaccessible formats
 - minimize risk during transition

This is not about romanticizing closed systems.
It’s about meeting them on their own terms so we can dismantle lock-in from the inside out.

## Expertise Isn’t Power; It’s Responsibility

Too often, specialization is equated with elitism. But there is nothing elitist about mastery if it is used to empower others.

Niche technical skills give us:

 - clarity in complex migrations
 - the ability to build translation layers
 - the confidence to respect existing constraints
 - the humility to preserve value while replacing vendors

Open source should not reject proprietary knowledge. It should transform it into freedom.

## Pragmatism Beats Dogma

Dogma says: “Avoid proprietary at all costs.” \
Pragmatism says: “Understand it so you can replace it responsibly.”

Open source wins not by refusing to engage with closed technologies, but by gradually rendering them obsolete — without harming the people who depend on them.

That requires:

 - reverse engineering with respect
 - migration planning grounded in reality
 - interoperable, sustainable alternatives
 - hands-on technical knowledge of both worlds

Freedom isn’t built in a vacuum.
It’s built through skillful, responsible transitions.

## The Bridge Matters

Niche technical expertise, even in proprietary domains, is the bridge between where we are and where we want to be.

It enables:

 - real migration strategies
 - practical open alternatives
 - minimized risk for users
 - preservation of business value

Open source is not just a destination.
It is a journey through complexity, legacy, and real human needs.

To liberate systems, we must understand them. \
To empower users, we must respect their starting point. \
To expand open source, we must build the bridges that make freedom achievable.
