# Why I Value Niche Technical Skills — Including Proprietary and Legacy Ones  
*An open-source manifesto*

I am a strong defender of open source.  
Precisely because of that, I deliberately invest time in **niche, proprietary, and legacy technical skills** — including technologies many would rather pretend no longer exist.

This is not nostalgia.  
This is pragmatism.

## Freedom Must Start From Reality

Open source stands for transparency, autonomy, and long-term sustainability. But freedom that ignores reality is only theoretical.

The reality is that a large part of the world still runs on:
- proprietary platforms and languages  
- vendor-specific tooling  
- closed data formats  
- **very legacy systems**, sometimes decades old  

Banks, governments, insurance companies, and critical infrastructure do not reboot every five years. Many of them still rely on technologies like **COBOL**, not by choice, but because they work — and because replacing them irresponsibly would be catastrophic. The 2020 pandemic exposed this brutally: U.S. state unemployment systems, still running COBOL, buckled under sudden demand — not because the language was flawed, but because no one was left who understood the systems well enough to adapt them quickly.

If I want open source to matter, I have to start where people actually are.

## Legacy Skills Are Not the Enemy

Legacy technologies are often framed as technical debt, obstacles, or failures of the past. I find that framing simplistic.

The legacy systems I have worked with exist because they:
- encode decades of business rules
- have proven stability at scale
- survived multiple technological cycles
- are deeply intertwined with real-world processes

COBOL, for example, is not "dead". It is *quietly critical*.

When I learn how these systems work, I am not endorsing their permanence.
I am building the prerequisite for **safely evolving or replacing them**.

## To Liberate a System, I Must Understand It Deeply

Vendor lock-in and legacy dependence are rarely superficial. They are embedded in:
- data models
- transaction semantics
- batch workflows
- undocumented assumptions
- institutional knowledge that no longer exists in writing

I have seen too many teams try to extract value from such systems by rewriting them blindly in a modern stack. That approach replaces one risk with another — and history is full of multi-year, multi-million migration projects that failed precisely because they treated the old system as a black box to be discarded rather than a body of knowledge to be transferred.

My niche and legacy technical skills allow me to:
- audit existing behavior precisely
- preserve critical logic during migrations
- design incremental exit strategies
- avoid functional regressions hidden by time

This is how liberation happens in practice.

## Proprietary and Legacy Knowledge as a Transitional Tool

When I learn a proprietary or legacy language, I am not defending it.

I am equipping myself to:
- translate closed logic into open systems
- decouple data from vendors
- expose interfaces where none existed
- reduce dependency step by step

For me, legacy expertise is a **transitional skill**.
It shortens the distance between closed pasts and open futures.

Without it, migrations become ideological rewrites instead of engineering processes.

## Open Source Needs Bridges, Not Purity Tests

Open source does not win by refusing to touch legacy systems.
It wins by **absorbing their value and outgrowing their constraints**.

That is why I am willing to:
- learn unpopular technologies
- read old code without judgment
- respect systems I intend to replace
- carry complexity so others don't have to

This is not glamorous work.
It is essential work.

## The Responsibility of Expertise

Deep, niche, and legacy skills create asymmetry. The person who understands the old system holds real power over those who depend on it. That asymmetry can be used to dominate — to become an indispensable gatekeeper — or to liberate.

I choose the latter.

Expertise should:
- reduce dependency, not increase it
- make systems understandable, not mystical
- leave users more autonomous than before

This is why I document what I find, build open interfaces around closed systems, and treat every migration as a knowledge transfer — not just a technical one.

Open source is not only about writing new software.
It is about **freeing existing systems from silent captivity**.

## In Short

I value niche technical skills — including proprietary and legacy ones like COBOL — because they give people a way out.

Not through slogans.  
Not through forced rewrites.  
But through careful, informed, and reversible transitions.

Open source is the destination.  
Legacy reality is the starting point.  
Niche expertise is the bridge between them.
